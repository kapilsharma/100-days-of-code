- Designed newsletter subscription form.

## Day 7: Sunday, March 24th, 2019.

- Completed articles accordian on home page.

## Day 6: Saturday, March 23rd, 2019

- Started working on articles on home page. Not completed.

## Day 5: Friday, March 22nd, 2019

- Completed top section (HTML design) of PHP Reboot. Looks good. Bootstrap is used only for the grid, rest all is custom CSS.

## Day 4: Thursday, March 21st, 2019

- Happy Holi. Although holiday, but was celebrating so couldn't do much.
- Made header of home page.
- With design, developed an idea of the site; Of the developers, by the developers, and for the developers.
  - Need to made point system, which will give more access to the developers.
  - This will be a bit of marketing :D

## Day 3: Wednesday, March 20th, 2019

- After further looking Bumla and tailwind, decided not to use them for following reasons:
  - Bumla's documentation is not clear and cant use it as master immediately
  - Tailwind seems good and I'd like to use it in future, but immediate priority is to complete phpreboot website. Once we have initial working version, we may change design and at that time, can use tailwind.
- Based on above reasons, decided to use bootstrap. It is proven and I and many other developer (who will probably contribute) have existing experience with bootstrap.
- Created menu in bootstrap. Code committed to issue-2 branch.

## Day 2: Tuesday, March 19th, 2019

- Megamenu in bootstrap doesn't looked good. Also, saw Taylor using tailwind. Thus decided to compare CSS frameworks today. Compared Tailwind, and Bumla against bootstrap.
  - Tailwind seems good but it do not have components. That means, there will be extra work on designing. Hmm, may be a last choice.
  - Made few examples with Bumla. Looks good but documentation is not too good.
- Status, still confused, Will check a bit more and if didn't find better choice, will go with bootstrap without mega menu.

## Day 1: Monday, March 18th, 2019.

- Issue#1 completed. Installed Laravel, generated PR and merged.
- Planning on code quality & development, created issue 4, 5, and 6.
- Issue#2 Not complete. Tried making mega-menu but failed :(
