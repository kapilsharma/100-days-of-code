# 100 Days Of Code - PHPReboot.com 3.0

## Day 2: Tuesday, March 19th, 2019

- Megamenu in bootstrap doesn't looked good. Also, saw Taylor using tailwind. Thus decided to compare CSS frameworks today. Compared Tailwind, and Bumla against bootstrap.
  - Tailwind seems good but it do not have components. That means, there will be extra work on designing. Hmm, may be a last choice.
  - Made few examples with Bumla. Looks good but documentation is not too good.
- Status, still confused, Will check a bit more and if didn't find better choice, will go with bootstrap without mega menu.

## Day 1: Monday, March 18th, 2019.

- Planning on code quality & development, created issue 4, 5, and 6.
- Issue#2 Not complete. Tried making mega-menu but failed :(
